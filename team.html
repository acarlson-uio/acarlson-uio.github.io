<h3>Dr. Annette Cazabuiel</h3>

<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="annette.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: right;" />
I am a postdoc working on the capture of droplets by fog nets. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway (NANO2021). I am also interested in the dynamics of flying seeds. During my PhD at Université de Paris, I performed experiments to study three different types of turbulence: hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence and integrable turbulence.

 <h3>Dr. Blandine F. P. Feneuil </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="Photo2.png" style="float: right;" />

I am a postdoc interested in rheology. My project at the University of Oslo is an experimental study of sedimentation of particles in complex fluids.
In my PhD at Paris Est University, I investigated rheological properties of cement foams, and how they affect foam stability. Funded by the Research Council of Norway in collaboration with the National Science Foundation in USA through the <a href="https://pire.ccny.cuny.edu">PIRE project</a> in collaboration with Prof. Atle Jensen.</p>

 <h3>Dr. Mathijs Janssen </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="mathijs.png" width="250" height="253" style="float: right;" />

I am a postdoc working on predicting coincedence detection during protein binding in cells with prof. Harald Stenmark and his group. I am also interested in the morphogenesis of plant leaves.
Before coming to Oslo, I obtained a Phd in theoretical physics from Utrecht University and I did a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute (IS) in Stuttgart. There, I studied the out-of-equilibrium behavior of electrolyte solutions near electrified surfaces, often in collaboration with experimentalists.
 The project is funded through the Scienta Fellowship Programme.

<h3>Vanessa Kern</h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="Kern_Photo.jpg" width="170" height="140" style="float: right;" />
I am a postdoc researching droplet interactions with elastic nano- and micro-porous materials to be used for water harvesting via fog nets, a project funded by the Research Council of Norway. 
During my PhD at Cornell University I did experiments on inviscid droplet impacts onto rigid solid surfaces with different configurations, as well as experiments investigating the mobility of the contact line. Some of my other research interests include drop-drop coalescence, drop impact onto soft solids and the forms assumed by vibrating sessile drops.</br>

 <h3>Dr. Tak Shing Chan </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="shing-chan-tak.jpg" style="float: right;" />

I am a researcher interested in problems of wetting dynamic, droplets, capillarity, micro-nano fluidics, dynamics of cell membranes. I use both analytical and numerical methods to study these problems in a project I am leading through the RCN.

 <h3>Christian Pedersen </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="christian-pedersen.png" style="float: right;" />

I am a PhD student with an interest in phenomena in engineering and biology that is dominated by viscous flows and free surface forces.</br>

Prior to this I did my BSc in HVAC engineering at the Oslo and Akershus University College of applied sciences (HiOA) and my MSc in applied mathematics here at the University of Oslo with emphasis on fluid mechanics.</p>

</br>

 <h3>Torstein Sæter </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="21.09.18.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="float: right;" />
My work is within several topics of fluid mechanics, among them elastohydrodynamic models, and free surface flows. 
  My PhD focuses on the applications of fluid mechanical models within geoscience, and numerically investigate the fracturing process driven by magma intrusion in the earth's crust. 
  My academical background is within marine hydrodynamics at NTNU, where I started to find interest in numerical analysis of physical problems. In between finishing the master's thesis and starting on this PhD, I worked one year as a naval architect/structural engineer. PhD is funded through the EarthFlow initiative.

<h3>Stephane Poulain</h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="stephane.jpg" width="170" height="140" style="float: right;" />
I am a PhD student with interest in interfacial fluid dynamics and its applications. The focus of my project is poroelasticity in the context of droplet transport, with the aim of developing efficient fog harvesting strategies. It is founded by the Research Council of Norway (NANO2021).
 Before joining Oslo University I studied Aerospace Engineering at ISAE-Supaero in France and obtained a Master of Science at MIT where I studied experimentally the physics of surface bubbles and evaporating drops.
