                received my PhD from the Linne Flow Center at the Royal Institute of Technology and did my post-doc at the Wyss Institute at Harvard University.
                I am fascinated by dynamic interface phenomena in engineering systems and biology, spanning from the dynamics of wetting droplets, flow of complex fluids, bubble traffic in microfluidic systems,
                soft robotics or cell dynamics. I use mathematical modeling and numerical simulations in combination with experiments.
            </p>

            <img src="annette.jpg" width="150" height="150" style="float: right;margin-left: 20px" />
            I am a postdoc working on the capture of droplets by fog nets. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway (NANO2021). I am also interested in the dynamics of flying seeds. During my PhD at Université de Paris, I performed experiments to study three different types of turbulence: hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and integrable turbulence.
        </p>

            I am a postdoc researching droplet interactions with elastic nano- and micro-porous materials to be used for water harvesting via fog nets, a project funded by the Research Council of Norway.
            During my PhD at Cornell University, I did experiments on inviscid droplet impacts onto rigid solid surfaces with different configurations, as well as experiments investigating the mobility of the contact line. Some of my other research interests include drop-drop coalescence, drop impact onto soft solids, and the forms assumed by vibrating sessile drops.

            <img src="shing-chan-tak.jpg" style="float: right;margin-left: 20px" />
            I am a researcher interested in problems of wetting dynamic, droplets, capillarity, micro-nano fluidics, dynamics of cell membranes. I use both analytical and numerical methods to study these problems in a project I am leading through the RCN.

            I am a Marie Skłodowska–Curie postdoctoral research fellow currently working on problems in double membrane wrapping and odd mechanics in soft matter. Before joining UiO, I was a postdoc in the EMBL-Australia Node at UNSW-Sydney, where I worked on problems in active nematic surfaces, the effects of ATP concentration in actomyosin, and HIV capsid-nuclear porin interactions.
            I completed my PhD as a cotutelle between the University of Warwick and Institut Curie (Sorbonne Université) studying stochastic and hydrodynamic effects on the dynamics of lipid membrane tubes.

            <img src="Bharti.jpg" width="180" height="180" style="float: right;margin-left: 20px" />
            I am a postdoc working on Dynamic wetting and adhesion on soft solids. The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway and led by Dr. T. S. Chan.
            I am interested in studying surface deformation of soft substrates. During my PhD at National Institute of Technology Patna, India, I have an analytic background. I used to give mathematical modeling of bacteria and viruses. Some of my research interest includes electrophoresis of hydrophobic soft particles and recently surface deformation of soft elastic/viscoelastic substrate.
            I am focused on analytical methods to study these problems.

            <img src="21.09.18.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="float: right;margin-left: 20px" />
            My work is within several topics of fluid mechanics, among them elastohydrodynamic models, and free surface flows.
            My PhD focuses on the applications of fluid mechanical models within geoscience, and numerically investigate the fracturing process driven by magma intrusion in the earth's crust.
            My academical background is within marine hydrodynamics at NTNU, where I started to find interest in the numerical analysis of physical problems. In between finishing the master's thesis and starting on this PhD, I worked one year as a naval architect/structural engineer. The PhD is funded through the EarthFlow initiative.

            I am a PhD student with interest in interfacial fluid dynamics and its applications. The focus of my project is poroelasticity in the context of droplet transport, with the aim of developing efficient fog harvesting strategies. It is funded by the Research Council of Norway (NANO2021).
            Before joining Oslo University, I studied Aerospace Engineering at ISAE-Supaero in France and obtained a Master of Science at MIT where I studied experimentally the physics of surface bubbles and evaporating drops.

            <img src="Vira.jpg" width="200" height="200" style="float: right;margin-left: 20px" />
            I am a PhD student interested in the physics of biological systems. My academic background is in engineering and physics, and I have previously worked on fluid mechanics for aerospace applications as well as the transport of small particles in the mammalian cytoplasm.
            In my current project, I am simulating the self-organisation of proteins during the formation of the immune synapse, which is essential for communication between cells in the immune system.
            Fluid flow, membrane deformation as well as protein binding and transport are taken into account of in the mathematical model.

            I am a postdoc working on cell membrane modelling and other micro-nano scale fluid problems. The position is provided by the AUTORHYTHM project. Prior to this, I was a PhD student at the University of Warwick, working on modelling of nanoscale thin liquid films using the fluctuating hydrodynamics, molecular dynamics simulations, and the rare event theory.
            We looked into the surface fluctuations of bounded thin films and the rare thermal fluctuation induced ruptures.
