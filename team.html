<h3>Dr. Susanne Liese</h3>
  </div>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="susanne.jpg" style="float: right;" />
The main focus of my research is on cell membrane dynamics.
<br>
Prior to coming to Oslo, I did my PhD at Free University in Berlin under the supervision of Prof. Roland Netz. In my PhD thesis I investigated the binding behavior of multivalent ligand-receptor pairs by means of statistical mechanics modeling and molecular dynamics simulation.
Project is funded by the Research Council of Norway.

 <h3>Dr. Blandine F. P. Feneuil </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="Photo2.png" style="float: right;" />

I am a postdoc interested in rheology. My project at the University of Oslo is an experimental study of sedimentation of particles in complex fluids.
In my PhD at Paris Est University, I investigated rheological properties of cement foams, and how they affect foam stability. Funded by the Research Council of Norway in collaboration with the National Science Foundation in USA through the <a href="https://pire.ccny.cuny.edu">PIRE project</a> in collaboration with Prof. Atle Jensen.</p>

 <h3>Dr. Mathijs Janssen </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="mathijs.png" width="200" height="200" style="float: right;" />

I am a postdoc working on predicting coincedence detection during protein binding in cells with prof. Harald Stenmark and his group. I am also interested in the morphogenesis of plant leaves.
Before coming to Oslo, I obtained a Phd in theoretical physics from Utrecht University and I did a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute (IS) in Stuttgart. There, I studied the out-of-equilibrium behavior of electrolyte solutions near electrified surfaces, often in collaboration with experimentalists.
 The project is funded through the Scienta Fellowship Programme.

 <h3>Dr. Tak Shing Chan </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="shing-chan-tak.jpg" style="float: right;" />

I am a postdoc interested in problems of wetting dynamic, droplets, capillarity, micro-nano fluidics, dynamics of cell membranes. I use both analytical and numerical methods to study these problems. The project is funded by UiO:LifeScience initiative at the University of Oslo.

 <h3>Christian Pedersen </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="christian-pedersen.png" style="float: right;" />

I am a PhD student with an interest in phenomena in engineering and biology that is dominated by viscous flows and free surface forces.</br>

Prior to this I did my BSc in HVAC engineering at the Oslo and Akershus University College of applied sciences (HiOA) and my MSc in applied mathematics here at the University of Oslo with emphasis on fluid mechanics.</p>

</br>
 <h3>Rossana Rojas </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="rossana-rojas.jpg" style="float: right;" />
I studied my bachelor in Physics in Venezuela and then I moved to Paris to do a Master program in Complex systems. One of the topics we studied in the Master was related to biological systems and basic fluid mechanics. Both subjects were of great interest to me and I can combine in my PhD project on cell membrane dynamics. The project is funded by the Research Coucil of Norway.
</br>

 <h3>Torstein SÃ¦ter </h3>
<p style="width: 500px;">
<img src="21.09.18.jpg" width="150" height="200" style="float: right;" />
My work is within several topics of fluid mechanics, among them elastohydrodynamic models, and free surface flows. 
  My PhD focuses on the applications of fluid mechanical models within geoscience, and numerically investigate the fracturing process driven by magma intrusion in the earth's crust. 
  My academical background is within marine hydrodynamics at NTNU, where I started to find interest in numerical analysis of physical problems. In between finishing the master's thesis and starting on this PhD, I worked one year as a naval architect/structural engineer. PhD is funded through the EarthFlow initiative.
